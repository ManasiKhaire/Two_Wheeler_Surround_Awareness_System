# Two_Wheeler_Surround_Awareness_System
This project uses an Arduino UNO and ultrasound sensors to detect objects within a fixed radius around a two-wheeler. It provides real-time distance and angle data and triggers an audio alarm if objects are too close to the rider, enhancing safety by alerting to nearby obstacles.
